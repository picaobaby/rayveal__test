neuroplasticity 


what that term means and how that applies to your recovery 


this video gives you the ten
key principles that are
important creating the neural
circuitry or the brain rewiring 

that is required to regain movement 

taken from an article that
is highly referenced 

when it comes to
neuroplasticity and learning, or how we
learn new behaviors, or learn new skills,

the foundation is to create neural circuitry around that behavior 

much different than
strengthening a muscle 


a goal of creating new
circuitry to develop a new skill or
behavior, 

——

<!-- .slide: data-state="layout-title" -->

principle number one is if you
don't use it you lose it

whether you are learning a new skill
such as riding a bike, or you are trying
to recover a movement after a portion of the brain that controls that movement, are used to perform that movement has
become damaged 


what this idea of if you don't use it you lose it 

if you don't use that arm
or that leg that was affected by the
stroke or affected by your brain injury, 
not only will you lose that ability but
the areas around that damaged area also will degrade 

so there is the potential
problem that may be an movement that you
lost or a portion of the brain that
wasn't damaged that is close to that
area over time 

if you don't use it you
will lose more function or you will even
lose more movement over time because those surrounding areas will also degrade

number two is if you use it, you will improve it 

treatment called constraint induced movement therapy, is an approach where you are placed in an environment, and asked to
perform skills where you are forced to
use the weak arm 


this idea of discouraging use of
the strong arm, and forcing use of the
weaker arm has been shown in multiple
research studies to improve overall
function of that weaker arm 

maintain that function even after the therapy had ended

and then principle number three is specificity

you have to train specifically

and what that means
is you can train every component of walking, 

lifting the leg 
bending the knee 
lifting the foot 
you can get all those movements
back 

but if you don't actually walk, there won't be as much carryover of those movements into walking 

so in order to improve the leg
movements that are required for walking, you actually want to practice walking 

Train specifically, choose activities that
are actually goals of things that you
want to get back to 


ask a question like what do you
want to walk to do , or what do you want to improve your balance for 

so that we
can also incorporate whatever that goal that vision that that
person has for what they want to be able
to what activity they want to be able to
return to 

if it is you want better balance to be able to return to playing golf, 

then I will try and incorporate
some type of swinging a golf club or
golfing activity into our balanced
activities so that we can train
specifically not only to strengthen the
the movements for required for it, but we can actually incorporate that into
swinging a golf club

and then principle number four is repetition  this is critical

there are two things, 
performing a movement
and learning a movement 


making sure that we're not just getting the result of having someone perform a movement,  but that we're also checking to see if they are learning the movement 


learning the movement means that when I am removed, that person could still perform that same quality of
movement later 


that means someone is actually learning the movement, and learning a movement happens with repetition repetition repetition


and where I see this in my practice and
clinically is that people will get
really excited in therapy because they
learned a new movement 

they want to move on to the next thing,  or they'll get really excited that they performed it in therapy and think like now I've got this, and they won't go home and continue to practice that new movement, 

they made that neural connection or they were able to create that neural circuitry, they did not go home and strengthen it,  therefore that circuit kind of atrophy 


the time in the clinic is really just the starting point,  but really to strengthen that neural circuitry and to like kind of hardwire it into your hard drive, your brain hard drive

it requires you once the cue are removed, once the therapist is once removed, once all the feedback is removed, that you can autonomously perform that movement over and over and over again 

so that you can get to a point where you no longer have to think about it, 
and it's less likely that you will lose that new movement, so that happens outside of therapy 

getting wired into that hard drive 


outside of therapy you need to do it over and over and over again 
so that you don't lose that movement, that you worked so hard to gain

so principle number five is intensity matters 

if you don't make the activities intense enough,  obviously you're not pushing that envelope a little bit  challenging, that brain to have to rewire and work, 


you want an activity to be challenging enough that you're forcing that brain to rewire,

<!-- .slide: data-state="layout-title" -->

principle number seven is salience matters 

motivated by rewards 

satisfaction of just doing something for
me that's important 

you want to make sure I call them purposeful activities 

always try and find things that have purpose or meaning to you that
you could slowly incorporate into your
rehab 


someone really wants to cook 
incorporate cutting or kneading dough 


to encourage you to put the work in but it also your brain is motivated to learn
that to achieve that purposeful activity

so finding things that are important to
you or meaningful to you  


incorporating that into the therapy session,  keeping someone engaged in the activity  holding their attention but
also learning a movement

principle number eight is age

——

number nine is transference, extremely important

so what this basically means
is that performing one activity in one
specific context will have some
carryover

I know I talked about specificity , but it will have some carryover into other activities so that's important because don't get too bogged down 

get this comment a lot what exactly should I do 

if you are doing anything in any of my videos because there's a ton of overlap in the activities there will be some carryover between activities 

so don't get too bogged down in selecting the perfect activity 

bottom line and I've said this before
move-move 

if all you can think to do is stand stand, 
whatever you do, just don't sit 

so I hope that made sense of the
transference that just move doing
activity don't get too bogged down on a perfect activity 

and you will get some benefit that'll carry over into some of the activities that you want to do like walking

principle number 10 is to be mindful of  interference

so there are some forms of stimulating the brain or stimulating the circuitry the
neural circuitry that can interfere with
other skills that you're trying to learn

and this actually recently happen to one of my patients 

she has some spasticity in her ankle and her foot points down, 

and she does have weakness and the muscles that lift the foot up

she is progressing and she is getting strength back in the muscles that lift the foot up

she started trialed the walk aid device 

and so she started using the walk aid, 
we noticed was that her actual voluntary movement in the
strengthening that she was getting back, in the muscles that lift the foot was decreasing 

the walk aid and this the which is if those of you that don't know
it's electrical stimulation that you
wear all the time and it trade 

it stimulates the muscles that lift the
foot when you're actually walking

what that was doing was it was interfering with the activity dependent
neuroplasticity that was going on during our sessions in in all the exercises that she was doing outside of therapy 

so she was doing a great job with the
repetition specificity 

she was going home she was doing all these activities and the muscle was getting stronger 

her walking was improving and she was
creating that neural circuitry when she
put the e stem on all of that remodeling
a reorganization that was going on based on her efforts of putting herself in these activity dependent situations and getting this neuroplasticity through
this activity dependent neuroplasticity
was being negatively impacted by now
putting electrical stimulation on that

so just another thing to be mindful of, 

of course I'm gonna tell you best case
scenario is that you're working with an
entire interdisciplinary team 

you have a neurologist on board you have a
physiatrist on board you do have a
physical therapist occupational
therapist on board and everyone's
collaborating together and that everyone
is mindful of these principles as you
continue to recover and return to the
activities that you love doing
